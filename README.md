<h1>LearnOn</h1>

LearnOn is web application I was developing in Laravel with the purpose of getting familiar with the framework. I was learning and researching about it while building it. Application is not completely finished, and the code is not the cleanest but by building it I have gained better understanding of MVC pattern, CRUD operations, and fundamentals of Laravel.
Application contains information about association or company (landing page, about us, contact), blog with categories (activities, education and posts), online course platform, user profile page and admin panel. Every visitor can read posts and see the list of archived courses. All registred users can attend archived courses and write posts (blog category). All members can write posts (in blog category) and attend all courses. Only administrator and authors can write posts in categories activities and education, and write courses.
